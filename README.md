# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

## The purpose of this analysis was to find the overall passing percentages of the students. There are a total of 15 schools and the idea was to find if there was any correlation between the budget each school gets and the overall passing percentages of the students. We were able to complete this analysis while working through the module. However, the challenge introduced a new obstacle: the test scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School were altered. We replaced these scores with NaN values and excluded them. Then we reran the analysis to see how the results were changed or affected.

# Results

## The district summary is not affected by the changes we made.

## The Overall Passing % for Thomas High School decreased by 0.32% from 90.95% to 90.63%

## By replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores, Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools was not greatly affected. The % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing decreased by less than 1%.

## By replacing the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School, the math_score_by_grade and reading_score_by_grade values became NaN values. Besides that, no other changes were affected.

## Scores by school spending, school size, and school type were all unaffected by the changes.
